#Mixed Messages : Project

This is a project from my current course at IT Career Switch

The aim was to practice skills aquired on the course so far, to use git and github to control versions, and to collaborate with 1 or more people to complete the project.

Unfortunatley I have not found someone to collaborate with so I have undertaken this myself.

I have decided to create a program that combines different quotes and superheroes who said them, but mixing each up.
As there was a requirement for 3 levels of 'mix', I have added different responses as well.

In addition I have decided on 3 different levels of this project, the first one being a simple javascript file. 
The second transferring this to an html rendering.
The third adding superhero pics to the mix. Responsive design was added to.

If you want to use this or collaborate with me on this or another project pls let me know.
